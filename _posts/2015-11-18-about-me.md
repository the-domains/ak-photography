# About Me

My father introduced me to photography when I was a young boy. My first camera was a Kodak 110, but I'm not telling you if it was a Mickey-Matic or not. Ever since then I've been in love with photography and what I can capture in my frame. Some of my best memories are the memories I can relive through the photos I've taken.
